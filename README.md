# home-recipes
Because being a developer doesn't mean you have to eat bad!

## Aim of the project
This little project aims to create a simple **Rest API** that can be a middleware between an *storage*, where the actual recipes will be stored, and a *front-end* that will get its information to print on the user's screen the different recipes.  

It is a simple app that doesn't focus on anything else rather than learning go, the *net/http* and the *gorilla mux* package.  

Also it will be used as a sample app for creating a *docker image* out of it, as well as *CI/CD pipelines* probably using *Jenkins*.
